# Tall tale about humanity in the style of Philip K. Dick



The human race had always been a Class-A civilization. That is, until the day the aliens came. The aliens were strange creatures, with large heads and big eyes. They came in peace, but they had a hidden agenda.

The aliens began to study the humans, and they soon realized that the humans were a primitive race. The aliens decided to help the humans evolve, and they did so by giving them knowledge. The humans began to grow and develop at an alarming rate, and soon they were a Class-A civilization.

The aliens were pleased with the progress of the humans, but they still had a hidden agenda. The aliens wanted to study the humans more, and so they decided to create a race of super-humans. The aliens did this by genetic engineering, and soon the first batch of super-humans was born.

The super-humans were stronger, faster, and smarter than the humans. They quickly began to dominate the humans, and soon the humans were nothing more than slaves. The aliens were pleased with the results of their experiment, and they decided to keep the humans as slaves.

The humans were forced to work for the aliens, and they were treated like animals. The aliens would experiment on the humans, and they would often use them for food. The humans were miserable, and they longed for freedom.

One day, a group of humans managed to escape from the aliens. They fled to a remote planet, and they began to build a new civilization. The humans were determined to never be slaves again, and they vowed to never let the aliens take over their world.

The humans fought against the aliens, and they eventually won. The humans were free, and they were able to build their own civilization. The humans had learned a valuable lesson from the aliens, and they would never make the same mistake again.
