# Song for old age based on the works of bell hooks



"We're getting old, we're getting old
We're not young anymore
We used to be so carefree
Now we've got to worry about our health
We've got to watch our step
We can't stay up late like we used to
We've got to get our rest
But even though we're getting old
We're still young at heart
We still have our dreams
We still have our hopes
We still have our love
And we'll never forget
The times we had together
We'll never forget
How good it felt to be young and carefree
But even though we're getting old
We'll never stop loving life
We'll never stop dreaming
We'll never stop hoping
We'll never forget
What it feels like to be young"
