# Parable considering revolution based on the works of Lev Tolstoy



Once upon a time, a group of people became tired of the way things were run in their country. They felt that the government was corrupt and that the people were not being treated fairly. So, they decided to start a revolution.

At first, things went well. The people were excited and full of hope. They overthrew the government and set up a new one. But soon, things started to go wrong. The new government was just as corrupt as the old one. The people became disillusioned and angry.

Finally, they realized that they had to take matters into their own hands. They had to start living according to their own principles, and not the principles of the government. This meant that they had to be willing to suffer for their beliefs. And so they did.

The revolution was not easy, but in the end, it was worth it. The people were finally free to live as they saw fit.
