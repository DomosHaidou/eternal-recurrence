# Song on food in the voice of Kwame Anthony Appiah



Kwame Anthony Appiah:

Food is the staff of life,
the sustenance that we need
to keep our bodies and minds strong.

It's essential for our health,
for our vitality and growth,
and for our ability to thrive.

Every culture has its own way
of preparing and enjoying food,
and we can learn so much from each other
just by sharing a meal.

So let's celebrate food,
the nourishment of body and soul,
and the joy of coming together
around the table.
