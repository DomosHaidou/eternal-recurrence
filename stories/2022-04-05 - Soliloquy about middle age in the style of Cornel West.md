# Soliloquy about middle age in the style of Cornel West


Once upon a time, I was young and fresh-faced with boundless energy and hope. I thought I had it all figured out. But now I am middle-aged and everything is different. My body is slower, my mind is not as sharp, and my dreams seem out of reach.

I sometimes feel like I am just marking time, waiting for the inevitable decline into old age. But then I remind myself that I am still here, still alive, still able to experience joy and love and all the good things life has to offer.

So I take a deep breath and I try to live in the present moment, appreciating all the good things that are still available to me. And I try to remember that even though I am not as young as I used to be, I am still young at heart.
