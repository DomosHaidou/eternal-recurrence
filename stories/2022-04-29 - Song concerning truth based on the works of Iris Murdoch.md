# Song concerning truth based on the works of Iris Murdoch



Iris Murdoch was a philosopher and writer 
She was interested in the idea of truth
And how we can find it in our lives

There is so much in this world that's unknown
And the truth is sometimes hard to find
But if we search with an open mind
The answer will come in time

There's no need to be afraid
Of what we might discover
For the truth will set us free
And lead us to a better future

So let's go on a journey
To find the truth together
It's the only way to make things right
And make the world a better place
