# Speech considering a subject of your choosing written by Baruch Spinoza



Spinoza's Ethics is a work of great beauty and power. In it, Spinoza argues that the ethical life is the good life, and that to live ethically is to live in accordance with reason. This argument is developed through a close examination of human nature, and an exploration of the nature of goodness and badness. The result is a work that is both philosophically rigorous and profoundly inspiring.

 Spinoza's Ethics is not only a work of great philosophical importance, but also a work of great personal importance. In it, Spinoza shows us the way to a life of fulfilment and happiness. He shows us that the good life is the life lived in accordance with reason, and that to live such a life is within the power of each and every one of us. The Ethics is a work that has the power to change lives, and I am proud to count myself among those who have been changed by it.
