# Short story concerning ethics in the style of Alan Watts



A young man was walking along a beach when he found a lamp. He rubbed it, and a genie appeared. The genie said, "I will grant you three wishes, but with each wish, you must choose between two options, and each option has a different ethical consequence."

The young man thought for a moment and said, "For my first wish, I want to be rich."

"Option A: You will become the richest man in the world. However, in order to maintain your wealth, you will have to sacrifice your happiness. You will never again experience the joy of a simple moment or the love of a close friend."

"Option B: You will be given enough money to live comfortably for the rest of your life. However, everyone you know will become poor."

The young man thought for a moment and said, "I choose Option B."

The genie said, "Your second wish?"

The young man said, "I want to be famous."

"Option A: You will be the most famous person in the world. However, you will be constantly in the spotlight and will never have a moment of privacy."

"Option B: You will be moderately famous. You will be recognized and admired by many, but you will still be able to live a relatively normal life."

The young man thought for a moment and said, "I choose Option B."

The genie said, "Your third wish?"

The young man said, "I want to be able to help others."

"Option A: You will be given the ability to help others in a very direct and tangible way. However, you will never be able to help yourself, and you will always feel like you are falling short."

"Option B: You will be given the ability to help others in a more indirect and intangible way. You will be able to inspire and motivate others to help themselves and others. However, you will never be able to directly help anyone."

The young man thought for a moment and said, "I choose Option B."

The genie said, "Your three wishes have been granted. I hope you have made the choices that will lead to the most ethical outcome."
