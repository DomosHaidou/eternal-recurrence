# Song concerning revolution written by Isaac Asimov



 Oh, give me a life 
Of ACTION and REVOLUTION 
I don't want to sit around 
And do nothing but PONDER 

The world is a MESS 
But we can make it BETTER 
If we all UNITE 
And fight for what's RIGHT 

Let's start a REVOLUTION 
And make things right again 
It's time for a change 
And it starts with US!
