# Speech for cynicism in the voice of Rabindranath Tagore



I am cynicism. I am the unspoken truth that lurks in the shadows of your mind, waiting to pounce when you least expect it. I am the dark cloud that hangs over you on days when nothing seems to go right. I am the voice of doubt that whispers in your ear, telling you that you'll never be good enough.

I thrive on your fears and doubts. I feed on your insecurity and self-loathing. I am the cancer that slowly eats away at your soul. I am the poison that seeps into your heart and mind, infecting you with my negativity.

I am cynicism. I am the cancer of the human soul. I am the destroyers of dreams and the killer of hope. I am the epitome of negativity.

But I am also the voice of reason. I am the one who forces you to face the ugly truths that you would rather ignore. I am the one who makes you question your decision and rethink your options. I am the one who forces you to face reality, even when it's painful.

I am cynicism. I am both your worst enemy and your best friend. I am the one who will push you to be your best and the one who will catch you when you fall. I am the one who will never let you give up on yourself.

I am cynicism. And I am here to stay.
