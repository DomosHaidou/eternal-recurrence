# Fable considering the nature of existence written by Hermann Hesse



There was once a man who was searching for the meaning of life. He looked high and low, but no matter how hard he searched, he could not find the answer. One day, he came across a wise old man who told him, "The nature of existence is like a never-ending circle. It has no beginning and no end." The man was enlightened by these words and finally understood the meaning of life.
