# Soliloquy for inspiration based on the works of Socrates



Socrates:

To find true inspiration, one must first find themselves.

This is not an easy task, for the self is often hidden away, buried beneath the everyday concerns and worries of life. But it is worth the effort, for only when we know ourselves can we begin to lead truly fulfilling lives.

Socrates believed that the key to happiness was self-knowledge. He believed that we all have within us a divine spark, a piece of the eternal that gives us our true identity. To find this spark, we must look within ourselves, to our deepest thoughts and feelings.

It is not easy to do this, but it is worth the effort. For when we know ourselves, we can begin to live our lives in accordance with our highest values and principles. We can begin to lead lives that are truly meaningful and fulfilling.
