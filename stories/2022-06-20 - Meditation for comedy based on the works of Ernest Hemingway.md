# Meditation for comedy based on the works of Ernest Hemingway



Life is a comedy. No, seriously. It is. Just think about it. All the things that happen to us, all the things we do, everything we say and think, it's all funny. If we could just step back and see the big picture, we'd laugh ourselves silly.

But we can't always do that, can we? We get caught up in the moment, in the drama of it all, and we forget to laugh. We forget that life is a comedy.

But maybe, just maybe, we can remember. Maybe we can find the humor in the everyday things. Maybe we can laugh at ourselves, and at the world.

And maybe, just maybe, we'll feel a little lighter for it.
