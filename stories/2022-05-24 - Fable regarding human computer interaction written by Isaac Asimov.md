# Fable regarding human computer interaction written by Isaac Asimov



There was once a man who was very interested in computers. He would spend hours upon hours tinkering with them, trying to figure out how they worked. He was so fascinated by them that he decided to become a computer scientist.

He studied hard and eventually became one of the leading experts on computers. He wrote books and articles about them, and he gave lectures all over the world. People would often ask him questions about computers, and he was always happy to answer them.

One day, someone asked him a question that he didn't know the answer to. The question was, "What is the best way to interact with a computer?"

The man thought for a moment, and then he said, "There is no one best way. It depends on the situation and on the individual."

This answer satisfied the person who had asked the question, and it has since become the standard answer to that question.
