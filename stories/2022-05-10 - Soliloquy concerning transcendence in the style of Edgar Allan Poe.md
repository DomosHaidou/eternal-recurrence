# Soliloquy concerning transcendence in the style of Edgar Allan Poe



I am not sure what transcendence is,

But I know that it is something beyond me.

Something that lies beyond the reaches of my mind,

And yet, I am drawn to it.

I yearn to touch it, to feel it,

To understand it.

It is a mystery,

A hidden treasure that I must find.

I will search for it,

 hunt for it,

Until I find transcendence.
