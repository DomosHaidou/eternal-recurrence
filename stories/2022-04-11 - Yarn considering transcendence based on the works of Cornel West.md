# Yarn considering transcendence based on the works of Cornel West



When it comes to transcendence, Cornel West is someone who knows a thing or two. For him, transcendence is not about escaping the world or living in some ethereal realm. Instead, it is about engaging with the world in a new and different way. It is about expanding our horizons and reaching beyond ourselves.

 Cornel West has said that "transcendence is a move from the particular to the universal, from the self to the Whole." In other words, it is about stepping outside of ourselves and our own narrow perspective and seeing the world from a broader, more objective standpoint. It is about connecting with something larger than ourselves and recognizing our place within it.

For West, transcendence is not something that is unattainable or out of reach. It is something that we can all strive for and achieve. It is a process of continual growth and development. By expanding our horizons and deepening our understanding, we can all transcend the limitations of our individual perspectives and connect with the greater whole.
