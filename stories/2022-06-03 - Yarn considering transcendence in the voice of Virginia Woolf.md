# Yarn considering transcendence in the voice of Virginia Woolf



The sound of the waves crashing against the shore is like a lullaby, calming and peaceful. I feel myself transported to another place, a place beyond the physical world. In this place, there is only peace and love. I am surrounded by a warm, white light, and I feel incredibly safe. I am free from the limitations of my body, and I feel myself expanding into the infinite. I am one with everything, and I understand the true nature of reality. I am transcending the physical world, and I am filled with a sense of wonder and awe.
