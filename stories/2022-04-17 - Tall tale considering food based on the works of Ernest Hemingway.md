# Tall tale considering food based on the works of Ernest Hemingway



Once there was a boy named Santiago. He was born in a small fishing village in Cuba. When he was five, his father took him out to sea on a small boat. Santiago soon became an expert fisherman. He could catch more fish than anyone in his village.

One day, when Santiago was out fishing, he caught a giant fish. It was so big that he could barely pull it into the boat. He was so excited that he rushed back to shore to show everyone his catch.

The fish was so big that it fed the whole village for weeks. Everyone praised Santiago for his catch. He was a hero.

Ever since that day, Santiago has been known as the greatest fisherman in the world. He has gone on to catch even bigger fish, and he always makes sure to share his catches with the people of his village.
