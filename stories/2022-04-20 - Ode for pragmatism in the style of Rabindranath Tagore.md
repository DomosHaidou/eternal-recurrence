# Ode for pragmatism in the style of Rabindranath Tagore



Prajnaparamita,

You are the mother of all Buddhas,

The wisdom that cuts through all illusion.

You are the perfect embodiment of compassion,

The one who shows us the way to liberation.

You are the practical one,

The one who knows that actions speak louder than words.

You are the one who shows us that the world is always changing,

And that we must adapt to survive.

Thank you for your wisdom,

Thank you for your compassion,

Thank you for your pragmatism.
