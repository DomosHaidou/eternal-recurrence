# Short story for existentialism in the voice of Hermann Hesse



Hermann Hesse was once asked what he thought about existentialism. "I'm not sure what it is," he replied, "but I think it has something to do with living life to the fullest."

Hesse was a German-born Swiss writer who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1946. His best-known works include the novels Siddhartha and The Glass Bead Game, as well as the short story "Narcissus and Goldmund".

Existentialism is a philosophical movement that emphasizes individual freedom and choice, and the inherent meaninglessness of life. Existentialists believe that humans must create their own meaning in life, as there is no inherent meaning in the universe.

Hesse's novels and stories often explore the themes of existentialism, such as the search for meaning in life, the individual's relationship to society, and the importance of making choices. In Siddhartha, for example, the titular character leaves his comfortable life in order to find meaning through suffering. In The Glass Bead Game, the protagonist withdraws from society in order to pursue his own intellectual interests.

 Hesse's stories often end with the protagonists reaching a state of contentment or understanding, even if they have not found what they were originally searching for. This mirrors the existentialist belief that it is the journey, not the destination, that is important.

In "Narcissus and Goldmund", the two main characters represent different aspects of the human condition. Narcissus is content with his life of solitude and introspection, while Goldmund is restless and yearns for adventure. Ultimately, Goldmund realizes that he must find his own path in life, even if it means leaving Narcissus behind.

Hesse's writings offer a deep and thoughtful exploration of the human condition, and his stories continue to resonate with readers today.
