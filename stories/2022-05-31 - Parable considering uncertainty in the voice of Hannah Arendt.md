# Parable considering uncertainty in the voice of Hannah Arendt



Once there was a young woman named Hannah who was very uncertain about everything. She was always questioning everything and she was never quite sure about anything. This made her very frustrating to her friends and family. They would often tell her that she was too questioning and that she needed to just trust them. But Hannah couldn't help it, she was just wired that way.

One day, Hannah's friends and family had had enough of her questioning. They decided to teach her a lesson. They took her out into the woods and left her there all alone. Hannah was terrified. She had no idea what to do. She didn't know which way was safe to go. She didn't know if she would ever see her friends and family again.

Hannah spent days wandering around in the woods, unsure of what to do. She was scared and alone. But eventually, she started to find her way. She started to trust her own instincts and she started to find her own answers. And after a while, she made it out of the woods.

Hannah's friends and family were amazed. They had never seen her like this before. She was different now, she was more confident. She had found her own voice. And from then on, Hannah was never uncertain again.
