# Poem considering food in the style of Isaac Asimov



Food, food, glorious food!
Hot soup and crusty bread
Cold cuts and chocolate cake

I cannot get enough
Of all this scrumptious fare
My appetite is insatiable

I'm like a bottomless pit
A never-ending buffet
One more bite, just one more dish

And I'm as happy as can be

Food, food, wonderful food
I love it more than I can say
It makes my every day
A happy, happy day!
