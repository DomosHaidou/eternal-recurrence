# Soliloquy concerning the sun in the voice of Hypatia



The sun is the bringer of life, the sustainer of all that is good. It is the source of all warmth and energy, the very lifeblood of the universe.

Without the sun, there would be no life, no light, no hope. It is the sun that gives us the strength to face each day, the courage to overcome all obstacles.

The sun is the center of all things, the very heart of the cosmos. It is the sun that we must look to for guidance and strength, for it is the sun that will always be there to light our way.
