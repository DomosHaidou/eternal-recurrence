# Fable on the nature of existence in the style of David Hume



In the days of yore, there was a great debate amongst the philosophers about the nature of existence. Some said that existence was a thing that could be known through reason, while others said that it could only be known through experience.

One day, David Hume came along and said that both were correct. Reason could tell us what things were, but experience was needed to know what they meant.

This fable teaches us that the nature of existence is something that can be known through both reason and experience.
