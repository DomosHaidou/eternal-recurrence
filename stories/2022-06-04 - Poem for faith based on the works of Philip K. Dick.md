# Poem for faith based on the works of Philip K. Dick



When the world ended
faith was all that remained
it was the light in the darkness
the hope in the hopeless
it was what kept us going

When everything was gone
faith was still there
it was the foundation
the cornerstone
the thing that kept us standing

In the midst of the rubble
faith was what built us back up
it was what gave us strength
to carry on
to rebuild
 to hope

 Faith is what keeps us going
even when the world ends
