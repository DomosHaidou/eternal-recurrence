# Song concerning faith based on the works of Albert Camus



It is faith that gives us strength
When we are faced with despair
It is faith that gives us hope
When all we see is darkness

It is faith that gives us courage
When we are afraid to go on
It is faith that gives us comfort
When we are lost and all alone

It is faith that gives us peace
In the midst of chaos and strife
It is faith that gives us joy
Even in the midst of tears

It is faith that gives us life
When all we see is death

Thank you Albert Camus for reminding us
That faith is the light that guides us through
The darkness of this world
