# Comedy on old age written by Philip K. Dick



The perils of old age are well known: wrinkles, arthritis, losing one's teeth, poor vision and hearing, and so on. But for some, there's an even greater danger: becoming a senile, dementia-ridden old person who is a burden on their families.

For these poor souls, life becomes a never-ending cycle of doctors' appointments, taking pills, and being shuffled from one nursing home to another. They become a shell of their former selves, a mockery of what they once were.

And yet, there is a silver lining to all of this. As they say, laughter is the best medicine. And so, in the spirit of laughter, here is a comedy about old age.

When I was a youngster, people used to ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I always gave the same answer: "I want to be old."

And now, here I am: old. But not just any old person, mind you. I'm a senile, dementia-ridden old person who is a burden on my family.

I know, I know. It's not exactly what I had planned for myself. But, in a way, it's kind of fitting. After all, growing old is all about accepting the fact that things will never be the way they used to be.

Sure, there are some drawbacks to being old. I can't see or hear very well, I have to take a bunch of pills every day, and I sometimes forget who my family is. But there are also some upsides to being old.

For instance, I get to spend a lot of time napping. And, thanks to my poor vision and hearing, I don't have to deal with telemarketers or door-to-door salespeople. And, best of all, I get to entertain my family and friends with stories of my senile antics.

So, if you're ever feeling down about growing old, just remember that it's not all bad. In fact, it can be downright funny.
