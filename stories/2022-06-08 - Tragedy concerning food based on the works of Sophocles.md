Sophocles' Tragedy of Food

The gods have been kind to Oedipus. He has been blessed with a beautiful wife, children and a prosperous kingdom. But there is one thing that the gods have not given him: food.

Oedipus is a great king, but he is also a terrible cook. Every dish he prepares is a disaster. His wife has to take care of the cooking because otherwise the family would starve.

One day, Oedipus decides to take matters into his own hands. He will learn how to cook, no matter what it takes. He goes to the marketplace and buys the best ingredients. He even hires a tutor to teach him how to cook.

But no matter how hard he tries, Oedipus just can't seem to get it right. Every dish he cooks is inedible. His family continues to starve.

One night, Oedipus has a terrible dream. He sees himself cooking a human baby in a stew. The next day, he realizes that the dream was a warning from the gods.

If he doesn't stop trying to cook, he will kill his own family.

Oedipus is a great king, but he is a terrible cook. And his tragic story will end in tragedy.
