# Parable for enlightenment in the voice of William Shakespeare



A young man and woman were in love and decided to get married. However, the woman's father did not approve of the young man and forbade them to marry. The young man was heartbroken and decided to leave the village and go off into the forest to live by himself.

One day, while he was out hunting, he came across a cave. Inside the cave was a beautiful woman who was also in love with him. She told him that she had been cursed by her father and was forced to live in the cave. The young man was sympathetic and decided to stay with her and help break the curse.

The two of them were happy together and eventually had a child. The woman's father found out about the child and came to the cave to take her away. The young man tried to stop him, but the father was too strong.

The young man was heartbroken again, but this time he knew that he had to do something to save his family. He went to the village and confronted the woman's father. He told the man that he loved his daughter and was willing to do anything to make her happy.

The father was touched by the young man's words and decided to let them marry. The young man and woman were finally able to be together and live happily ever after.
