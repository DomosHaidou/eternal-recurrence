# Reflection on art in the style of RenÃ© Descartes



When I look at a work of art, I am struck by the way that it seems to transcend the physical world. The artist has captured something essential about the subject, and in doing so has created a thing that is more than the sum of its parts.

It is this ability to capture the essence of a thing that makes art so special. And it is why, when I contemplate a work of art, I am filled with a sense of wonder. For in these works, I see the hand of God at work, creating something beautiful and true.
