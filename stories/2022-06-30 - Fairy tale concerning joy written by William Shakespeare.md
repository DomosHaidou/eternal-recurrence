# Fairy tale concerning joy written by William Shakespeare



The day started like any other. The sun rose in the sky and the birds began to sing. But there was something different in the air. It was as if the world was filled with joy.

No one could explain it, but everyone felt it. It was like a blanket of happiness that wrapped around everyone. Even the grumpiest person couldn't help but smile.

The day went on and the joy only grew. It was as if nothing could bring anyone down. Laughter filled the air and everyone seemed to be in a good mood.

No one could explain where the joy came from, but everyone was happy for it. It was a day that would be remembered for years to come. A day when the world was filled with nothing but pure joy.
