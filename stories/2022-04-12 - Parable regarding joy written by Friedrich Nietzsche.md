# Parable regarding joy written by Friedrich Nietzsche



There was once a young woman who was desperately searching for joy. She tried everything she could think of, but nothing made her happy. One day, she came across a wise old woman who told her that joy could be found within herself. The young woman didn't believe her at first, but she decided to give it a try. She meditated, prayed, and did everything she could to find joy within herself. Eventually, she found what she was looking for, and she was never the same again.
