# Parable about joy in the style of Albert Camus



There was once a woman who was so full of joy that it radiated from her every pore. It was said that when she entered a room, the entire atmosphere would lighten up and everyone who met her would feel happier just from being in her presence.

One day, a man who had been feeling particularly down and out came across this woman. He was amazed by her joy and asked her how she could be so happy all the time.

She replied, "I have found the secret to happiness. I wake up each day and choose to be joyful. No matter what happens during the day, I remain positive and focus on the good. It's not always easy, but it's definitely worth it."

The man was so inspired by this woman's happiness that he decided to try out her approach to life. From that day forward, he too chose to be joyful each day. And sure enough, his life began to change for the better. He found himself attracting more good things and feeling happier more often.

This woman's secret to happiness is definitely worth sharing. So next time you're feeling down, remember to choice to be joyful and see how it changes your day!
