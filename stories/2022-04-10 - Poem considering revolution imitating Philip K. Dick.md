# Poem considering revolution imitating Philip K. Dick



The revolution will not be televised 
It will be a digital simulation 
A Philip K. Dick adaptation 

The revolution will not be fought with guns 
But with ideas and information 
With words and thoughts and dreams 

The revolution will not be televised 
It will be a battle of minds 
And whoever has the better ideas 
Will be the one who wins
