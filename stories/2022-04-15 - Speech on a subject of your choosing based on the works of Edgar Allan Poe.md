# Speech on a subject of your choosing based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe



Thank you for inviting me to speak today. It's great to be here.

I'd like to talk about one of America's greatest writers, Edgar Allan Poe. Poe was a master of the macabre, and his stories are filled with suspense, horror, and mystery. Poe was also a great poet, and his poems are dark and haunting.

Poe was born in Boston in 1809, and he was orphaned at a young age. He was raised by his foster father, John Allan, a wealthy merchant. Poe had a troubled relationship with Allan, and he left home at the age of eighteen.

Poe enrolled in the University of Virginia, but he was soon forced to leave due to gambling debts. He returned to Richmond and got a job as a clerk in an attorny's office.

Poe's first book, "Tamerlane and Other Poems," was published in 1827. Poe then joined the army, but he was soon discharged.

Poe moved to Baltimore and began working for a newspaper. He also started writing stories and poems for magazines. In 1835, Poe's poem "The Raven" was published, and it made him famous.

Poe married his cousin Virginia in 1836. Virginia was only thirteen years old, and she became sick soon after the marriage. Poe was devastated when she died of tuberculosis in 1847.

Poe's health began to decline, and he became increasingly paranoid and reclusive. He died in October 1849, and the cause of death is still a mystery.

Poe was a brilliant writer, and his works have inspired countless other writers. His dark and haunting tales are timeless classics. Thank you for inviting me to speak today.
