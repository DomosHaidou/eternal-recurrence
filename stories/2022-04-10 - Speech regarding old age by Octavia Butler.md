# Speech regarding old age by Octavia Butler



"There is no denying that getting old isn't what it used to be. We are living longer, but often not in the best of health. Our bones ache, our skin wrinkles, and our minds aren't as sharp as they once were. But even though our bodies may be betraying us, we refuse to give in. We are the generation that fought in World War II, endured the Great Depression, and marched for civil rights. We are a generation of survivors and we are not going gentle into that good night.

So what is the secret to staying young at heart? I believe it is to keep learning, to stay curious, and to never stop fighting for what you believe in. Age may be just a number, but it is also a state of mind. So don't let the years weighing you down, instead let them be a source of wisdom and strength. Embrace your age, and never stop growing."
