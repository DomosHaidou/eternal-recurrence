# Song on the moon in the voice of Lao Tzu



There is no greater mystery than the moon

It's a beacon in the night, drawing us in

With its soft light and ethereal beauty

The moon is a force that cannot be denied

And yet it remains ever out of reach

Lao Tzu knows the moon is a symbol of the divine

And like all things in nature, it is to be worshipped

The moon is a reminder that we are but dust

And yet we are also something much more

We are the stuff of stars, and the universe itself

And the moon is a reminder of that

It's a reminder that we are connected to something greater

And that we are never truly alone

The moon is a mystery, and Lao Tzu knows

That its beauty and power will never be fully understood

But that doesn't stop him from trying

And it doesn't stop him from feeling the pull of the moon

Lao Tzu knows that the moon is a force to be reckoned with

And he will continue to look to it for guidance and wisdom

 until the day he dies.
