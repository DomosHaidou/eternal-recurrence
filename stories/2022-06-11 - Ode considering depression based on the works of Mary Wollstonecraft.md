# Ode considering depression based on the works of Mary Wollstonecraft



Depression, thou art a cruel mistress
Thou robb'st me of my will to live
My days are dark, my nights are darker still
I wish for naught but sweet oblivion

I used to be a woman of fire
My passion burned bright and true
But now those flames have been extinguished
And all that's left is this dull ache

I used to take joy in small things
A pretty flower, a sunny day
But now those things just make me sad
And I can find no joy in anything

I used to be full of hope and dreams
But now those have all been dashed
I can see no future for myself
And so I sink into this dark abyss

Depression, thou art a cruel mistress
Thou robb'st me of my will to live
My days are dark, my nights are darker still
I wish for naught but sweet oblivion
