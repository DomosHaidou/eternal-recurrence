# Yarn about mortality in the voice of RenÃ© Descartes



I think, therefore I am. This simple statement has been the foundation of my philosophical work. It is the starting point for all of my thinking.

But what does it mean? What is it that I am?

I am a thinking thing. I am a thing that doubts, that understands, that affirms, that denies. I am a thing that wills, that chooses, that imagines. I am a thing that feels pleasure and pain, that perceives. I am a conscious thing.

But I am also a mortal thing. I am a thing that is subject to birth and death. I am a thing that will one day cease to exist.

 This is a hard truth to accept, but it is a truth that I must face. My own mortality is something that I cannot avoid. It is a part of my nature.

One day, I will die. This is inevitable. And when I die, I will cease to exist. I will no longer be a thinking thing, a conscious thing. I will no longer be anything at all.

This is a difficult thing to contemplate. But it is a fact of life. And it is something that I must come to terms with.
