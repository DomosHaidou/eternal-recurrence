# Song about action in the voice of Cornel West



 Cornel West:

"Action is the antidote to despair."

It is the thing that we must do

When all we want to do is hide

It is the light that guides us through

The dark and scary night

Action is the only way

To make our dreams come true

It is the force that will propel us

Into the life we were meant to live

Action is the only thing

That can save us from ourselves

It is the key to unlock

The door to our future

Action is the only way

To create the change we need

It is the engine that will drive us

Towards a better tomorrow

So let's take action today

And make our dreams come true
