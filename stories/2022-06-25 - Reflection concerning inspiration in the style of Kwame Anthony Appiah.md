# Reflection concerning inspiration in the style of Kwame Anthony Appiah



When we are inspired, we are moved to action by something outside ourselves. This something can be a person, a book, a story, or an event. Whatever it is, it speaks to us in a way that moves us to change our lives.

Inspiration is not a passive experience. It is an active response to something that has touched us deeply. When we are inspired, we feel a sense of purpose and possibility. We are moved to action because we believe that what we are doing is important and that we can make a difference.

Inspiration is a powerful force in the world. It has the ability to change lives and to change the world. We all have the power to be inspirers. We can be the force that moves people to action. We can be the ones who make a difference.
