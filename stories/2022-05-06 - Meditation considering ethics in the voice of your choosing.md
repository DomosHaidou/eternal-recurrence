# Meditation considering ethics in the voice of your choosing





I sit here and ponder the meaning of ethics. What is it that drives our actions and motivates us to do what is right? Is it an innate sense of morality, or is it something that we learn through experience?

I believe that ethics is something that we learn through experience. We are constantly bombarded with choices, and each choice we make teaches us a lesson. Over time, we develop a moral compass that guide us towards the path of righteousness.

However, there are times when our ethical compass becomes skewed. We may be faced with a choice that is difficult to make, or we may be tempted to act in a way that is not morally upright. In these moments, it is important to pause and reflect on what we believe is right and wrong. We must consult our ethical compass and make the choice that we believe is best.

No matter what path we choose in life, we must always be mindful of our actions and the impact they have on others. We must strive to act in a way that is ethical and just, so that we can create a world that is filled with compassion and love.
