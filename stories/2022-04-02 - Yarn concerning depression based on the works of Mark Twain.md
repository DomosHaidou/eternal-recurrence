# Yarn concerning depression based on the works of Mark Twain


Some people are born sad. That's just the way they are. They go through life with a permanent cloud over their head, no matter what the weather is like outside. They're like walking rainstorms.

 Depression is like a black hole. It's a If you're not careful, it will consume you. It will suck the life out of you until you're nothing but a shell of a person.

There are many different types of depression, and it can affect people in different ways. But one thing is for sure: it's a real and serious illness that should not be taken lightly.

If you or someone you know is struggling with depression, please seek professional help. There is no shame in admitting that you need help. Just like with any other illness, depression is something that can be treated. There is hope.
