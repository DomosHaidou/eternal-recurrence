# Poem regarding the stars written by Epictetus



The stars are my friends
The constellations are my guide
They've been with me through thick and thin
And I know they'll always be there

No matter what life throws my way
I can always look up and find solace
In the beauty of the night sky

The stars are my friends
And I thank them every day
For the light they bring to my life
And the hope they give me for the future
