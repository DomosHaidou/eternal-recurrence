# Fairy tale on middle age in the style of Arthur Conan Doyle


There was once a middle-aged woman who lived in a small village. She was a kind and gentle woman, and she was loved by all who knew her. One day, a traveling troupe of entertainers came to the village, and the woman was captivated by their performance. She asked the troupe to stay with her for a while, and they agreed.

The woman was very hospitable, and she treated the troupe members like family. They shared stories and laughter around the fire each night, and the woman was happy to have them in her home.

One night, the woman was awakened by a noise outside her window. She looked out to see a group of men on horseback, armed with swords and bows. The men were calling for the troupe to come out and entertain them.

The woman was terrified, and she hid under the bed. She could hear the men ransacking the house, and she knew that they would find her eventually. She prayed for a miracle, and then she heard the sound of horses galloping away.

When she dared to come out from under the bed, she saw that the troupe had been taken away by the men. She was all alone in the house, and she knew that she would never see her friends again.

The woman was heartbroken, but she did not give up. She went to the nearest town and told the authorities what had happened. They mounted a search for the troupe, but they were never found.

The woman never forgot her friends, and she always wondered what happened to them. She hoped that they were happy and that they were entertaining the men who took them away.
