# Essay for theoretical particle physics based on the works of David Hume



In his treatise on the nature of causation, David Hume argued that our perceptions of cause and effect are based on nothing more than patterns that we have observed in the past. In other words, when we see two events happening together repeatedly, we come to see them as causally related. This is the basis of our understanding of the physical world.

Hume's theory has important implications for our understanding of the subatomic realm. According to Hume, our perceptions of particles and their interactions are based on patterns that we have observed in the past. This means that our understanding of particles is always provisional and subject to revision in light of new evidence.

This is an important point to keep in mind when considering the strange and unpredictable world of particle physics. We should not expect to ever have a complete and definitive understanding of the subatomic realm. Our understanding of particles is always evolving, and new discoveries will continue to surprise and confound us.
