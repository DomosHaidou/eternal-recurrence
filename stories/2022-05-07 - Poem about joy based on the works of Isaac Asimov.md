# Poem about joy based on the works of Isaac Asimov



The world is a joyous place,
No matter what the case,
For in every person's face,
There shines a joyous trace.

It comes from being part of the human race,
And sharing in the great adventure
Of discovering all that life has to offer.

We can find joy in the simplest things,
Like a child's laughter or a song,
For these are the things that make us feel alive.

And when we see the world through eyes of love,
We realize that joy is all around us,
Just waiting to be found.
