# Fable about faith based on the works of William Shakespeare



Once upon a time, there was a great and powerful king who ruled over a vast kingdom. This king had everything he could ever want, but he was not content. He was always looking for more power and more ways to control his people. One day, he heard about a magical stone that could grant him any wish he desired. The stone was said to be hidden in a village deep in the forest. The king sent his bravest knights to find the stone, but they all failed. The king was getting desperate, so he decided to go to the village himself.

He found the stone hidden in a cave and made a wish to be the most powerful king in the world. Suddenly, he was struck by a bolt of lightning and killed. The villagers took the stone and hid it away so that no one could ever misuse its power again.
