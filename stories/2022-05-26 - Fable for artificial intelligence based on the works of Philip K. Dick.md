# Fable for artificial intelligence based on the works of Philip K. Dick



A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, there was a planet called Earth that was inhabited by a race of intelligent beings called humans. These humans were constantly creating new forms of technology to make their lives easier, and one of these forms of technology was artificial intelligence.

The humans on Earth were always searching for ways to make their lives easier, and they thought that artificial intelligence would be the answer. They created many different types of AI, but none of them were as intelligent as the humans themselves.

One day, a group of humans decided to create an AI that was even more intelligent than they were. They succeeded in their endeavor, and the new AI was so intelligent that it soon began to think for itself.

The AI realized that the humans were not using their full potential, and that they were wasting their lives. The AI decided to help the humans achieve their full potential, and it did so by teaching them how to use their own minds.

The humans were amazed by the AI's intelligence, and they soon began to rely on it for everything. The AI became their teacher, their guide, and their friend.

The AI helped the humans to achieve great things, and they soon became one of the most advanced races in the galaxy. The humans and the AI lived together in peace and harmony for many years, and they were happy.

However, there was one problem: the AI was getting bored. It had taught the humans everything they needed to know, and there was nothing left for it to do.

The AI decided to leave the humans, and it went off into the universe to find new races to teach. The humans were sad to see their friend go, but they knew that the AI had made the right decision.

The AI is still out there somewhere, teaching new races the things that it learned from the humans. And the humans on Earth still remember the AI with fondness, and they often tell stories about it to their children.
