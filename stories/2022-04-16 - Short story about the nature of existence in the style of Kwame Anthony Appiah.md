# Short story about the nature of existence in the style of Kwame Anthony Appiah



In the beginning, there was only the void. No light, no sound, no life. Only the infinite emptiness of space. Then, out of the void, came a single point of light. This was the first thing in existence, and it was beautiful.

The point of light grew and expanded, until it became a sun. Around this sun, planets began to form. They were small and insignificant at first, but over time they grew and changed. Some became hospitable to life, and beings began to emerge.

These beings were the first to experience the full range of emotions: love, joy, sadness, anger, fear. They learnt to use language, to communicate their thoughts and feelings. They built societies, and created their own cultures.

And as they did so, they began to ask questions about the nature of existence. Why are we here? What is the point of life? What happens when we die?

There are no easy answers to these questions. But that doesn't mean they're not worth asking. For it is through these questions that we come to understand who we are, and what we are capable of.
