# Tragedy considering realism written by James Joyce



It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

Mr. Darcy is a wealthy man, and as such, he is in want of a wife. He meets Miss Elizabeth Bennet, and though he is initially put off by her lack of refinement, he soon comes to appreciate her intelligence and wit.

They fall in love, but due to a series of misunderstandings, they are forced to part ways. Elizabeth is heartbroken, and Darcy is consumed with regret.

A few months later, Darcy receives a letter from Elizabeth's father, informing him that she has died in childbirth. Darcy is devastated, and his guilt consumes him. He spends the rest of his life alone, haunted by what could have been.
