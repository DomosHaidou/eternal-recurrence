# Ode about pragmatism in the style of Paul Sartre



Praise to pragmatism,
the philosophy of the working man.

Too often we dwell on theory,
 forgetting that it's only useful
 insofar as it helps us achieve our goals.

You cut through the bullshit
 and tell us what we need to do
 to get the job done.

You remind us that the world
 is a messy place,
 and that we can't always
 have things our way.

Let others continue to talk
 about what could be,
 while we get down to business
 and make things happen.
