# Essay concerning ethics in the style of Mark Twain



One ethics question that has always intrigued me is whether it is ever ethically acceptable to lie. This is not a cut and dry question, as there are many factors to consider. For example, if someone lies to save a life, is that ethically acceptable? Is it ever ethically acceptable to lie to save face?

There are many different schools of thought on this topic. Some people believe that it is always wrong to lie, no matter what the circumstances. Others believe that there are some circumstances where it is acceptable to lie. For example, some people believe that it is acceptable to lie if doing so will prevent harm to another person.

I am not sure where I stand on this issue. On one hand, I can see the argument that it is sometimes necessary to lie in order to prevent harm. On the other hand, I can also see the argument that lying is always wrong, no matter what the circumstances. I think this is a complex issue with no easy answer.
