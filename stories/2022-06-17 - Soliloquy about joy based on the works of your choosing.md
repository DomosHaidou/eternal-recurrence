# Soliloquy about joy based on the works of your choosing



I am joy. I am what you feel when you're at your best. I am what you feel when you accomplish something great. I am what you feel when you're surrounded by your loved ones. I am what you feel when you're doing what you love. I am pure happiness. I am laughter. I am love.

I am what makes life worth living. I am what makes you feel alive. I am what makes you want to keep going, even when things are tough. I am what gives you hope. I am what makes you believe in yourself.

I am always with you, even when you're feeling down. I am always with you, even when you don't think you can go on. I am always with you, because I am part of you. I am part of your soul.

I am joy. And I will never leave you.
