# Ode on economics in the style of Isaac Asimov



Ode to Economics



You are the most fascinating of sciences,
the study of mankind's material well-being.
You are the foundation of civilization,
the engine of progress.

You are the science of trade and commerce,
of money and financial markets.
You are the science of production and consumption,
of supply and demand.

You are the study of how people use resources,
of how they transform them into goods and services.
You are the study of how people work and earn,
of how they spend and save.

You are the science of wealth and poverty,
of abundance and scarcity.
You are the science of progress and stagnation,
of prosperity and recession.

You are the study of how economies grow and develop,
of how they change over time.
You are the study of how societies move forward,
and how they can be improved.

Thank you, Economics, for all that you teach us.
May we always use your principles wisely,
and may we always strive to make the world a better place.
