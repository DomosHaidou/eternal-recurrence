# Speech about youth written by William Shakespeare



Good evening ladies and gentlemen. It is I, William Shakespeare, and I am here to talk to you about youth.

What is youth? Is it a time of innocence, of exploration, of recklessness? Or is it something else entirely?

To me, youth is a time of potential. It is a time when we are unencumbered by the responsibilities of adulthood, and we have the opportunity to dream, to hope, to imagine.

It is a time when we are discovering who we are and who we want to be. We are discovering our talents and our passions. We are making mistakes and learning from them.

And it is a time when we are full of energy and optimism, when anything seems possible.

So let us seize this time, my friends. Let us make the most of it. Let us use our youth to build a better future for ourselves and for the world.

Thank you.
