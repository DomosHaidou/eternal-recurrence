# Ode regarding realism based on the works of James Joyce



Ode to Realism

In a world of artifice and artifice,
your work is a breath of fresh air.
You eschew the false and the contrived,
instead choosing to write of the real.

The world is your oyster,
and you paint it as it is,
warts and all.
You don't shy away from the dark side of life,
but instead confront it head-on.

Your work is a mirror
that reflects the human condition
in all its beauty and ugliness.

Thank you, James Joyce,
for your unflinching realism.
