# Tall tale about truth based on the works of Judith Butler



Once upon a time, there was a woman named Judith Butler who believed that truth was a social construct. She believed that everyone had their own version of the truth, and that it was up to each individual to decide what was true for them. One day, she decided to put her beliefs to the test. She went out into the world and started telling people her truth. To her surprise, no one believed her. They all thought she was crazy. She didn't give up, though. She kept telling her truth, and eventually she found people who did believe her. They were the ones who helped her build a community of like-minded individuals, and together they created a movement based on the idea that everyone has the right to their own truth.
