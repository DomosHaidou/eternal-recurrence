# Ode considering uncertainty in the style of Ernest Hemingway



In the dark of night
I think of you
I can't be sure
If you're thinking of me too

Our future is cloudy
 Uncertainty hangs in the air
 But I'm not afraid
 I know we'll make it through

Together we'll face whatever comes
We'll weather any storm

So when uncertainty comes knocking
Just know that I'll be there
 Standing by your side
 Ready to take on the world
