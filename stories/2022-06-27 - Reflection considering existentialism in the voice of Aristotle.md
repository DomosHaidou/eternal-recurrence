# Reflection considering existentialism in the voice of Aristotle



There is no such thing as an "existence" apart from what we ourselves make of it. Existence is nothing more than the sum of our own actions, thoughts, and feelings. We create our own meaning in life, and it is up to each of us to give our lives purpose and direction.

Existentialism is not about living in a vacuum, free from all responsibility and concern for others. Quite the opposite; existentialism is about taking full responsibility for our own lives and choices. It is about being fully engaged in the world, and making the most of our time here.

Aristotle was one of the first philosophers to realize that we are responsible for our own lives. He understood that our choices have consequences, and that we must be mindful of the impact our choices have on ourselves and on others. Aristotle's insights are just as relevant today as they were 2,000 years ago.

Existentialism is not a philosophy of despair or nihilism. It is a philosophy of hope and possibility. It is a call to each of us to create our own lives, and to make them meaningful and valuable. We each have the power to make our lives what we want them to be. Existentialism is a reminder that we should never take this power for granted.
