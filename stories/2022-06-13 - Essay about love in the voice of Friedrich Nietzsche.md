# Essay about love in the voice of Friedrich Nietzsche



Love is a virtue. It is not a vice.

Love is neither light nor dark.

Love is not aflame with passion.

Love is patient and kind.

Love is not jealous or boastful.

Love is not arrogant or rude.

Love does not insist on its own way.

Love is not irritable or resentful.

Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

Love never fails.
