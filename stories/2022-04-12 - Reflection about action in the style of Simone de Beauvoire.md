# Reflection about action in the style of Simone de Beauvoire



Actions, for me, are a way of asserting one's own freedom while also respecting the freedom of others. They are a way of asserting our autonomy and asserting our place in the world. Actions are a way of saying "I am here, and I am going to do something."

Actions are a way of making our dreams and hopes a reality. They are a way of taking control of our lives and our destiny. Without action, we are just drifting through life, letting things happen to us. With action, we can make things happen.

Actions are not always easy. They often require us to step out of our comfort zones and to face our fears. But, ultimately, actions are what make us who we are. They are what make us alive.
