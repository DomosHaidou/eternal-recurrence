# Journal entry considering truth in the style of Octavia Butler



What is truth?

Is it something that we can know for certain? Or is it something that is ever-changing, depending on our perspective?

 Personally, I think that truth is something that is ever-changing. Just like our understanding of the world changes as we learn new things, so too does our understanding of truth.

What is true for one person may not be true for another. And what was true in the past may not be true in the present. Truth is not static – it is always shifting and evolving.

This can be seen in how our beliefs and opinions change over time. What we once thought was true may later be proved false. Or what we once thought was false may later be proved true.

This is why it’s so important to always be open to new information and to question what we think we know. Only by doing this can we hope to get closer to the truth.
