# Fairy tale about joy in the style of Haruki Murakami


Once there was a woman who was so full of joy that it overflowed from her and spread to everyone she met. Her joy was so infectious that it even affected the grimmest of creatures, like the blackest of ravens or the sourest of lemons. Even when the woman was faced with difficulties, her joy never wavered. It was this joy that gave her the strength to overcome any obstacle.

One day, the woman met a man who was as joyless as a stone. He had never known happiness and didn't believe it was possible for him to feel any other emotion. But the woman's joy was so powerful that it melted the man's heart and he finally felt happiness for the first time in his life.

The man and the woman got married and had a beautiful baby girl. They named her Joy, after the emotion that had brought them together. And they lived happily ever after.
