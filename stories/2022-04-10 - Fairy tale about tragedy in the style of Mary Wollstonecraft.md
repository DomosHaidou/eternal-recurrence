# Fairy tale about tragedy in the style of Mary Wollstonecraft



There was once a beautiful young woman named Mary who was loved by all who knew her. She was kind and gentle, and everyone who met her felt better for having met her.

One day, Mary met a man who was different from anyone she had ever met before. He was handsome and charming, and Mary felt drawn to him instantly. They began dating, and Mary was happy for the first time in her life.

However, the man was not what he seemed. He was cruel and abusive, and Mary soon found herself trapped in a nightmarish relationship. She was constantly beaten and humiliated, and she felt like she was losing her mind.

One day, the man went too far and Mary ended up dead. Her body was found by her loved ones, and they were devastated.

This is a tragedy, but it is also a cautionary tale. Mary's story is a reminder to always be careful who you let into your life.
