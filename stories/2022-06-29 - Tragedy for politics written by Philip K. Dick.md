# Tragedy for politics written by Philip K. Dick



In a future America torn by civil war, the government has developed a new weapon: a powerful mind-control drug. But when the drug is accidentally released into the water supply, the entire population is soon addicted.

As the addiction takes hold, people begin to lose touch with reality. Politicians become even more corrupt and power-hungry, while the general population descends into madness.

The country soon collapses into anarchy, and the few remaining sane people are left fighting for their lives in a world gone mad.
