# Yarn regarding realism based on the works of Philip K. Dick



Dick was a master of blending the real and the unreal, often with devastating effect. In "The Minority Report," for example, he showed how a future society could be based on false premises, leading to tragic consequences. In "Paycheck," he again overturned our preconceptions, this time about time travel. His work continues to challenge us, even after his death.
