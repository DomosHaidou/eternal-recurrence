# Soliloquy on ambiguity in the style of Dante Alighieri



My thoughts on ambiguity are constantly changing.

One moment, I think that it is a good thing,

A tool that we can use to keep people guessing

And to keep them off balance.

But then the next moment, I think that it is a terrible thing,

A monster that devours meaning and leaves only confusion in its wake.

I swing back and forth between these two extremes,

Never quite sure which is the correct way to feel.

Part of me wants to embrace ambiguity,

To see it as a challenge to be overcome.

But the other part of me wants to run away from it,

To hide in the comforting certainty of the known.

I just don't know what to do with ambiguity anymore.

It confuses and frustrates me.

But I can't seem to escape it,

No matter how hard I try.
