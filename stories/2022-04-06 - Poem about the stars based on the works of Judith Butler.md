# Poem about the stars based on the works of Judith Butler

The stars are like a blanket,

Covering the sky in a shroud of light.

They twinkle and shine,

A reminder that we are not alone.

Butler says that the stars

Are like a sign of hope,

A reminder that there is something

Beyond this world.

And I agree,

The stars are beautiful and bright,

And they give me hope

That there is something more out there.
