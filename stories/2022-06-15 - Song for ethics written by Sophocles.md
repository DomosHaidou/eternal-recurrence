# Song for ethics written by Sophocles



In the eyes of the law

I am innocent 
But in the eyes of the gods
I am not 
I have done what is right
 But it was not enough
It seems that in ethics
 The ends do not justify the means

I have fought for what is good
 But I have not won 
I have done what is right
 But it was not enough
It seems that in ethics
 The ends do not justify the means
 
I have killed in self-defense
 But that is not enough
I have done what is right
 But it was not enough
It seems that in ethics
 The ends do not justify the means
 
I have lied to protect the innocent
 But that is not enough
I have done what is right
 But it was not enough
It seems that in ethics
 The ends do not justify the means
 
I have stolen to feed the hungry
 But that is not enough
I have done what is right
 But it was not enough
It seems that in ethics
 The ends do not justify the means
 
I have done what is right
 But it was not enough
It seems that in ethics
 The ends do not justify the means
