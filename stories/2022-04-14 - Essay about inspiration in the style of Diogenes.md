# Essay about inspiration in the style of Diogenes



When it comes to inspiration, I like to think of myself as a bit of a Diogenes. I'm not looking for the conventional sources of inspiration; instead, I'm looking for the things that inspire me in my everyday life. I find inspiration in the simplest of things, like a smile from a stranger or a sunset over the ocean. It's these little moments that inspire me to live life to the fullest and to appreciate the beauty that surrounds us.
