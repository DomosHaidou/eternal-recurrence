# Poem for quantum physics written by Hypatia



Quantum physics is the study of
the very small world of particles
that make up our universe.

It's a world of great mystery,
 full of strange and wondrous things.

The more we learn about quantum physics,
the more we realize how little we know.

There's so much to explore in this field,
and we've only just scratched the surface.

Who knows what secrets quantum physics may hold?
 perhaps they hold the key to unlock the universe.
