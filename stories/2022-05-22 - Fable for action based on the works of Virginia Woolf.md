# Fable for action based on the works of Virginia Woolf



There once was a woman named Virginia Woolf who was a very talented writer. She wrote many novels, short stories, and essays. Her work was very influential and helped to shape the literary world. One day, she was asked to write a fable for action. She thought for a moment and then began to write.

Once upon a time, there was a woman who lived in a small village. She was very poor and had to work hard to support her family. One day, she was asked to help a rich woman who was having a party. The woman needed someone to clean the house and prepare the food. The poor woman agreed to help and did a great job.

After the party was over, the rich woman asked the poor woman if she could stay and help her with something else. The poor woman agreed and followed the rich woman into her study. The rich woman sat down at her desk and began to write. The poor woman was amazed at how quickly the words flowed from the rich woman's pen.

The rich woman asked the poor woman if she would like to learn how to write like she did. The poor woman was thrilled and agreed. The rich woman taught her everything she knew and the two became good friends.

The poor woman continued to practice her writing and eventually became a great writer herself. She was able to support her family and live a better life. She was very thankful to the rich woman for everything she had learned.
