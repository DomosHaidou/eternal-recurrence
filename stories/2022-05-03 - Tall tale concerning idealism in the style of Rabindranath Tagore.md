# Tall tale concerning idealism in the style of Rabindranath Tagore



"The Idealist"

Once there was an idealist who lived in a world of dreams. He believed that if he could just find the right person, or the right situation, then everything would be perfect. Unfortunately, the real world is not always so ideal, and the idealist often found himself disappointed.

But he persisted, because he knew that his dreams were worth pursuing. And eventually, he found what he was looking for: a perfect partner, and a perfect life. Together, they built a beautiful world where everyone was happy and everyone got along.

It was a utopia, and it was everything the idealist had ever dreamed of. But sadly, it didn't last. Over time, people started to fight and argue, and the utopia began to unravel.

The idealist was heartbroken, but he still believed in his dreams. He knew that one day, he would find another perfect partner and build another perfect world. And he was right.
