# Song for art based on the works of Fyodor Dostoevsky



"Brothers and sisters,

Art is the light that guides us through the dark,

And Dostoevsky was the artist who showed us the way.

He painted a world of tragedy and hardship,

But also of hope and redemption.

His characters are like family to us,

And their stories will stay with us forever.

Thank you, Fyodor,

For everything."
