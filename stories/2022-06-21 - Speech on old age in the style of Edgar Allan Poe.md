# Speech on old age in the style of Edgar Allan Poe



The role that age plays in our lives is a topic that is often spoken about, but seldom understood. Age is not simply a number that denotes the amount of time we have been alive. Age is a state of being, a state of mind. It is a measure of our experience, of the wisdom we have gained through the years. It is a testament to the strength of our character, to the resilience of our spirit.

 Age is not something to be feared or to be shunned. It is something to be celebrated. It is a badge of honor that we wear with pride. It is a reminder of all we have been through and all we have accomplished.

So let us embrace our age, embrace the wisdom and experience it brings. Let us use it to make the world a better place. Let us be an inspiration to those who are younger, and show them that age is just a number, and that life is meant to be lived to the fullest.
