# Journal entry for justice in the style of Alan Watts



Justice is a funny thing. It's like a game of tug-of-war, where each side is trying to pull the other over to their side. And in the end, justice is usually about who has the most strength.

But sometimes, justice is about more than just strength. It's about who has the most truth on their side. And that's where things can get really tricky.

Because sometimes, the truth is not as clear as we would like it to be. There are gray areas, and sometimes people can legitimately see the same thing in different ways.

That's why justice is so important. It's not just about punishing the bad guys and rewarding the good guys. It's about finding the truth, and making sure that everyone is treated fairly.

It's a hard job, but somebody has to do it. And I'm glad that there are people out there who are dedicated to justice.
