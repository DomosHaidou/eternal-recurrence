# Tall tale for politics based on the works of Paul Sartre



There once was a politician named Jean-Paul Sartre who was known for his notoriously long speeches. In fact, his speeches were so long and tedious that his audience often times fell asleep before he even finished. Nevertheless, Sartre was undeterred and continued to give speeches that few people actually listened to.

One day, Sartre was giving a speech to a large crowd of people. However, instead of falling asleep, the crowd started to get restless and began to boo and jeer at him. Sartre, who was used to this sort of reaction, simply continued speaking as if nothing was happening.

But then, something miraculous happened. In the middle of one of his long-winded sentences, Sartre suddenly started speaking in tongues! The crowd was shocked and amazed as they listened to him speak in a language they didn't even know.

Some people claimed that it was a sign from God, while others said that Sartre was possessed by the devil. But no one could deny that it was one of the most amazing things they had ever witnessed.

From that day on, Sartre became a political legend, and his speeches were eagerly awaited by the public. They never knew what would happen next when they heard him speak, and that was part of the appeal.

Who knows what sort of things Sartre will say next? Only time will tell.
