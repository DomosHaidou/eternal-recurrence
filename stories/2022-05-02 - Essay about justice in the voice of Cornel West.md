# Essay about justice in the voice of Cornel West



"Justice is what love looks like in public."

-Cornel West

When I think about justice, I think about what it means to love others and to ourselves. Justice is about making sure that everyone is treated fairly and that their rights are protected. It's about ensuring that everyone has access to the same opportunities and resources, and that they're not being discriminated against.

Justice is also about accountability. It's about making sure that those who have committed harm are held accountable for their actions and that they don't get away with anything. It's about making sure that the victims of crimes are given a voice and that they're not forgotten.

Justice is about making sure that everyone is treated with dignity and respect. It's about making sure that everyone is valued and that their voices are heard. It's about making sure that everyone has a chance to live a good life.

Justice is what love looks like in public. It's about making sure that everyone is treated fairly and that they're not being discriminated against. It's about making sure that everyone has access to the same opportunities and resources. And it's about making sure that those who have committed harm are held accountable for their actions.
