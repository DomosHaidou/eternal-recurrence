Quantum physics is the branch of physics that explores the very small world of particles at the atomic and subatomic level. In quantum physics, the rules of classical physics no longer always apply. This means that subatomic particles can exist in more than one state at the same time. Quantum physics can help us to understand the strange and often seemingly bizarre behavior of particles on a very small scale.

Quantum physics is a fascinating field of study. It helps us to understand the strange and often seemingly bizarre behavior of particles on a very small scale. Quantum physics is not only important for understanding the world around us, but also has the potential to help us develop new technologies and devices that could have a profound impact on our lives.
