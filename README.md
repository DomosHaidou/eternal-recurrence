Kwame Anthony Appiah was a man who knew joy. He was a man who celebrated life, even in the face of adversity. He was a man who understood that joy is the engine that drives us forward.

Appiah was a man who was always looking for the next adventure. He was a man who was always seeking out new experiences. He was a man who was always looking for ways to bring joy into the world.

Appiah was a man who believed that joy is the birthright of all human beings. He believed that joy is what makes us truly alive. He believed that joy is what connects us to the rest of humanity.

Appiah was a man who lived his life with joy. And in doing so, he inspired others to do the same.

Today, as we remember Appiah, let us also remember the joy that he brought into the world. Let us remember the joy that he showed us is possible. Let us remember the joy that is our birthright. And let us use that joy to fuel our own lives, and the lives of those around us.
