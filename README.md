Adventure is something to be sought
It's a journey we all must take
To find out what life is really about

Aristotle said it best
"The more we know, the more we realize how little we know"

So let's go out and explore
See the world and all it has in store
Create our own adventures
And see where they take us

Who knows what we'll find
 when we step out of our comfort zone
It might just be the best thing we ever do

So let's go forth and be brave
See what adventure has in store
And live our lives to the fullest
