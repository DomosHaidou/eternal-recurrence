Once upon a time, there was a land where ambiguity reigned supreme. No one knew what anything meant, least of all the king. The king consulted his advisors, but they could not agree on the meaning of anything either.

The king's daughter was the only one who seemed to have any clarity in her life. She was sure of what she wanted and went after it with a fierce determination.

One day, she came across a frog who was also looking for some clarity in his life. They became friends and decided to help each other out.

Together, they went on a journey to find the answer to the question: What does it all mean?

They traveled far and wide, asking everyone they met for the answer, but no one could give them a straight answer.

Finally, they came to a wise old woman who told them that the answer they were looking for could only be found within themselves.

The frog and the princess realized that they had been looking in all the wrong places and that the answer was inside them all along.

They went back to the king and shared what they had learned with him. From then on, the land was filled with clarity and everyone was able to live happily ever after.
