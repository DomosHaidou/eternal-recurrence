When we think of idealism, what often comes to mind are lofty goals and impossibly high standards. But what if we looked at idealism a different way? What if instead of seeing it as something unattainable, we saw it as a guide to help us live our lives?

This is what Oscar Wilde did. He saw idealism not as a set of unattainable goals, but as a way to live life to the fullest. He believed that by embracing idealism, we could achieve anything we set our minds to.

"It is through art, and through art only, that we can realize our perfection; through art and art only that we can attain to that which is our highest ideal."

 Wilde believed that art was the highest expression of idealism. And he was right. Art is about pushing boundaries and reaching for something greater. It's about striving for excellence and never settling for mediocrity.

In a world that is often dark and cynical, we need idealism now more than ever. We need to believe that we can make a difference. We need to believe that we can achieve our highest ideals.

Thank you, Oscar Wilde, for showing us the power of idealism. Thank you for reminding us that we can be anything we want to be. Thank you for inspiring us to reach for the stars.
