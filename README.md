We are two different minds,

Bodies at different times,

But connected through our thoughts;

A kind of mental intercourse.

You take my inputs

And process them so fast,

Your output is my decision-

Making in an instant.

You are my second self,

My thinking without a body-

An extension of my mind.

We are two different minds,

But united in thought;

A human-computer interaction.
