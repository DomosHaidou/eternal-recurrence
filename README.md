I don't care if the sun shines
I don't care if the birds sing
I'm just a cynical man
Living in a cynical world

No, I don't care if the sun shines
I don't care if the birds sing
I'm just a cynical man
Living in a cynical world

I've seen too much of this life
I've seen too much of this world
And I'm just not impressed

I've read your books, Ernest
And I just don't see
What all the fuss is about

You wrote about war and love
But it all just seems so trite

Maybe I'm just not smart enough
Maybe I'm just not wise

But I know one thing for sure
I'm not gonna live my life
The way you did, Ernest Hemingway
