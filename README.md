Ernest Hemingway,

I know you're feeling down,
I know that you're feeling blue.
I know that you're thinking maybe life's just not worth living through.

But I want you to know,
that even though you're gone,
your life mattered to me and to everyone else who knew you.

So please don't give up,
please don't give in,
please don't think that your life was a waste.

It's not too late,
to turn things around,
to start living again.

I know it's hard,
I know it seems impossible,
but you're stronger than you know.

So don't give up Ernest Hemingway,
don't let depression win.

You're worth fighting for,
you're worth living for,
you're worth everything.

Never forget that.
