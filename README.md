When the world's most famous playwright, Oscar Wilde, was sentenced to two years in prison for "committing acts of gross indecency with other male persons," it was a national scandal. Wilde was immediately ostracized by polite society and his plays were banned from the stage.

But Wilde refused to be defined by his prison sentence. He continued to write, and even managed to get his work published while he was behind bars.

One of Wilde's most famous works, "The Ballad of Reading Gaol," was based on his own experience of incarceration. The poem is a searing indictment of the penal system, and it helped to bring about reform in the way prisoners were treated.

 Wilde's experience of tragedy and injustice served to inspire his work, and his words continue to resonate long after his death.
