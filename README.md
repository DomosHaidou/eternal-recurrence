Come all ye fair maidens and listen to my tale
Of the greatest adventurer that ever did sail
He left his home in England, seeking new shores
In a tiny boat he set out to explore

The sea was rough and the wind was high
But he never once thought to turn back
He had a dream and he was going to try
To make it come true, no matter the cost

For weeks he battled the elements
And finally arrived on distant shores
He had many adventures, both good and bad
And he learned so much along the way

Now he's back home in England once more
And he's glad to be safe and sound
But he can't help but to yearn for more

 adventures out on the sea
He knows that's where he's meant to be

So if you're feeling brave and bold
And you're looking for something new
Why don't you set sail like Shakespeare did
And go and find your own adventure!
