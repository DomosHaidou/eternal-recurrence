The moon was once a star, shining bright in the sky. But it became tired of shining and decided to go on a journey. It traveled to the far corners of the universe, meeting many different creatures along the way. Eventually, it found itself at the edge of the universe, where it met a creature made of pure energy. The two of them talked for a while, and the moon learned that this creature was the last remaining star in the universe. The creature told the moon that it was destined to die, but the moon didn't want to believe it. The creature said that all stars must eventually die, but the moon didn't want to accept that. It begged the creature to tell it how to avoid death, but the creature said that there was no way to avoid it. The only thing the creature could do was to give the moon a piece of its own energy, so that the moon could continue to shine even after the creature was gone. And so the creature gave the moon a piece of its own light, and the moon has been shining ever since.
