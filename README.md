We are mortal beings, and this fact is at the root of much of our anxiety. The knowledge that we will die one day – that our time is limited – can be a source of great fear.

But mortality can also be a source of strength and resolve. It can remind us of what is truly important in life, and help us to live each day to the fullest.

When we come to terms with our mortality, we can find a new appreciation for life. We can cherish our time on earth, and make the most of every moment.
