There is something awe-inspiring about the universe and its vastness. It's hard to wrap our minds around just how big it is and how long it's been around. Isaac Asimov did a great job of explaining some of the science behind it all in his work. I find it amazing that we have been able to learn so much about the universe and its history. It's a reminder that there is still so much to learn and explore.
