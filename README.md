There is no greater good than idealism
It is the wellspring of all that is great
In it we find the courage to hope
And the strength to make our dreams real

It is the noblest of all things
To strive for something better
To know that we can be better
And to never give up on that hope

It is the fire that burns within us
The desire to make a difference
To make the world a better place
For all who live in it

It is the highest of all ambitions
To make our ideals a reality
And in doing so, to make ourselves better
For having striven for something more
