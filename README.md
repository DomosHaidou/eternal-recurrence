Justice is a way of life

It is always there to guide us

And show us the path to take

When we falter, it is there to catch us

And help us back on our feet

So that we can continue on our journey

 Justice is always fair

And it never takes sides

It is always there to see us through

And help us make the right choices

So that we can live a life of harmony
