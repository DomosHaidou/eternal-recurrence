"Wilde Actions"

We're taking our Wilde actions,
To live life to the fullest
No matter what the cost,
Our days are filled with purpose

We're on the hunt for adventure,
Our spirits never quench
Our passion is unending,
Our desire to experience

We'll push on through the hardships,
We'll never back down
Our resolve is unshakeable,
Our ambition is boundless

We are the embodiment of Wilde,
Living life on our own terms
Daring to be different,
Never conforming to the norm

Our lives are a work of art,
A tapestry of colors and hues
A story that's always unfolding,
Never to be repeated

This is our time,
This is our moment

Let's make the most of it,
Carpe diem!
