There was a man who was always seeking the truth. He was never satisfied with anything he heard, because he always felt there was more to the story. This man was always asking questions and looking for more answers. He was always seeking clarity and understanding.

One day, he came across a situation that was very confusing to him. There were two people arguing about a certain topic, and he couldn't tell who was right and who was wrong. He didn't know what to believe, so he just stood there and listened.

Eventually, he realized that both sides had valid points, and that there was no clear right or wrong answer. He also realized that this was okay, because sometimes life is ambiguous and there is no clear answer. He learned to accept ambiguity and to be okay with not knowing everything.
