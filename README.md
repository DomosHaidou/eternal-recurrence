# eternal recurrence

> prompt: Please write an original essay about a subject of your choosing in the style of Paul Sartre.



Existence precedes essence. This is what Sartre means when he says that man is "condemned to be free." We are free to choose what we will do with our lives, and in that way we create our own essence. Our choices are what make us who we are.

We are constantly making choices, whether we realize it or not. Every time we decide to do something, we are choosing who we want to be. For example, if I decide to go to the gym every day, I am choosing to be a healthy person. If I decide to eat junk food all the time, I am choosing to be a lazy person.

The options we have in life are endless. We can choose to be anything we want. The only limit is our own imagination.

So what does it mean to be free? It means that we are responsible for our own lives. We are the ones who decide what we want to do with our time. We are the ones who decide what kind of person we want to be.

Freedom is a heavy burden. It can be scary to think that we are in control of our own lives. But it is also empowering. We can choose to do anything we want with our lives. We can be anyone we want to be.

So what will you choose? What kind of person do you want to be? The choice is yours.
