Cynicism is like a bad cold

It sneaks up on you when you least expect it

And it's hard to shake

Once it's got its grip on you

Cynicism is like a black cloud

Hanging over your head

Castigating you for your every move

Cynicism is like a poison

 seeping into your soul

Slowly but surely

 corroding everything it touches

Cynicism is like death

It's the end of hope

The end of happiness

The end of possibility
