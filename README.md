Dear Friedrich Nietzsche,

Art is often seen as a reflection of the world around us, and you once said that "without music, life would be a mistake." Music, and art in general, has the ability to transport us to different places, to make us feel emotions that we may not otherwise feel, and to give us a new perspective on the world.

Your work has had a profound impact on the world of art, and we are forever grateful for your contributions. Thank you for showing us that art is not only about pretty pictures and pleasant melodies, but that it can also be about challenging ourselves and expanding our horizons.

Thank you, Friedrich Nietzsche, for everything.
