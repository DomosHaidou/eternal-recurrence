In a world where the elderly are venerated and the young are scorned, one youth dares to challenge the status quo.

Josen is a young man who has had enough of being treated like a child. He's tired of being told what to do and how to behave. So, he decides to strike out on his own and prove that he is just as capable as anyone else.

He quickly learns that the world is not as easy as he thought it would be. He's constantly tested and challenged, but he never gives up. He knows that he has to keep going if he wants to prove that youth can be a force for good in the world.

Josen's journey is not an easy one, but it is one that will change the way people think about youth forever.
