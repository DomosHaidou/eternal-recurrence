The first time I ever saw a steamboat was on the Mississippi River. It was a large, flat-bottomed boat, with a tall chimney in the middle, and it looked very odd to me. I later found out that these boats were called "steamboats."

I was curious about how they worked and how they were able to move. I found out that they had a large boiler on board that heated up water and created steam. The steam was then used to power the boat's engine.

I thought it was amazing that something like this could exist. It seemed so impractical and yet it worked. It was a real-life example of something that I had only seen in pictures before.

Now, many years later, I still marvel at the steamboat and its ability to move through the water. It's a real-life example of how something that seems impossible can actually be possible.
