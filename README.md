Old age is a time of wisdom and experience. It is a time to reflect on our lives and learn from our mistakes. It is also a time to enjoy the company of our friends and family, and to make new memories.

 Hypatia, we honor you today not only because you are one of the oldest members of our community, but also because you are one of the wisest. Your life is a testimony to the fact that age is just a number, and that it is never too late to learn and grow.

Thank you for sharing your time and your wisdom with us. We are all better for having known you.
