It is not enough to simply produce and consume, we must also question the economic system that enables this production and consumption. We must constantly ask ourselves: what is the point of all this production and consumption? What are we really trying to achieve?

A healthy economy is not one that produces and consumes blindly, but one that is based on critical thinking and questioning. We must be constantly asking ourselves what we truly need, and what we can live without. Only then can we hope to create a sustainable and productive economy.
