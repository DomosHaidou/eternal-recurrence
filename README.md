Iris Murdoch was one of the most celebrated novelists of the 20th century. Her body of work included 25 novels, numerous philosophical treatises, and plays. She was also a teacher and a public intellectual. In 1999, she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and died in 2019.

I remember Iris Murdoch as a woman of great intelligence and wit. She was a gifted writer who had a profound understanding of the human condition. Her novels explored the depths of human relationships and the ways in which we can be both good and evil. She was a true original, and her death is a great loss.
